Linux
üêç How to Install Python on Linux

Most Linux distributions come with Python preinstalled. However, if you need a newer version or it's missing, follow these steps based on your distribution.

Step 1: open the terminal you can open with (ctrl+alt+t )
python3 --version
If you see something like Python 3.x.x, Python is already installed. If not, proceed to the next step.

Step 2: you can install Python on Debian, Ubuntu, and Derivatives (Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, etc.)
for that action that is downdoald python on Linux you need to put this in your terminal.

This is for update package lists
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
This is for installing python:

sudo apt install python3 -y
In this step you will install the Python packege manager.

sudo apt install python3-pip -y
And finally you need to verify that it has been installed correctly.

python3 --version
Step 3: If you have more than one vertion of python and you want ‚Äúpython‚Äù to be the same as ‚Äúpython3‚Äù you will do that:

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 1
Check if this install you need to put this in your terminal:

pip3 install virtualenv
‚úÖ Great, you already have python in Linux, you can now program.

C++ Installation (MacOS, Windows, Linux)
MacOs
Step 1: Check if you have a C++ compiler
Open your terminal and you will put this:

clang --version
Step 2: If you do not have a C++ compiler, you will see how you can install that.

brew install gcc
If you have questions, you can corroborate with this command in your terminal:

g++ --version
Step 3: Finally, if you want to use VSC, it is so easy, you have VSC only you have to install the Extnsion C/C++ by microsoft and create a file but you have to write ‚Äúcpp‚Äù at the end.

Windows
Step 1: You need to install a C++ compiler.

Option 1: Install MinGW-w64, this is recommended for beginners, you can install from the official website, select and download the vertion more recommended.

g++ --version
if you have information about g++, you have a c++ compiler, but you dont have g++ information, you have to install a c++ compiler.

Step 2: You can install in diferents operational systems for each one has diferent commands. Run this commands in your terminal.

sudo dnf install gcc-c++
c. Arch Linux:

sudo pacman -s gcc 
d. OpenSUSE:

sudo zypper install gcc-c++
Verify if it is install and it running.

g++ --version
Step 3: Install VS code to run C++

Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt install code
Fedora

sudo dnf install code
Arch Linux

sudo pacman -S code
Finally you have to install the extension.
